document represents one viewpoint I would encourage read widely draw conclusion relevant book listed companion article To provide sense cohesion progression I presented article imaginary conversation atheist theist All question asked imaginary theist question cropped repeatedly alt atheism since newsgroup created Some frequently asked question answered companion article Please note article arguably slanted towards answering question posed Christian viewpoint This FAQ file reflect question actually asked predominantly Christians proselytize alt atheism So I talk religion I talking primarily religion Christianity Judaism Islam involve sort superhuman divine Much discussion apply religion may What atheism Atheism characterized absence belief existence God Some atheist go believe God exist The former often referred weak atheist position latter strong atheism It important note difference two position Weak atheism simple scepticism disbelief existence God Strong atheism positive belief God exist Please fall trap assuming atheist strong atheist Some atheist believe non existence Gods others limit atheism specific Gods Christian God rather making flat denial But disbelieving God thing believing exist Definitely Disbelief proposition mean one believe true Not believing something true equivalent believing false one may simply idea whether true Which brings u agnosticism What agnosticism The term agnosticism coined Professor Huxley meeting Metaphysical Society 1876 He defined agnostic someone disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin thing must cause unknown unknowable Thus agnostic someone belief cannot know sure whether God exists Words slippery thing language inexact Beware assuming work someone philosophical point view simply fact call atheist agnostic For example many people use agnosticism mean weak atheism use word atheism referring strong atheism Beware also word atheist many shade meaning difficult generalize atheist About say sure atheist believe God For example certainly case atheist believe science best way find universe So philosophical justification basis atheism There many philosophical justification atheism To find particular person chooses atheist best ask Many atheist feel idea God presented major religion essentially self contradictory logically impossible God could exist Others atheist scepticism see evidence God exists But impossible prove non existence something There many counter example statement For example quite simple prove exist prime number larger prime number Of course deal well defined object obeying well defined rule Whether Gods universe similarly well defined matter debate However assuming moment existence God provably impossible still subtle reason assuming non existence God If assume something exist always possible show assumption invalid finding single counter example If hand assume something exist thing question provably impossible showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible place thing might found show Such exhaustive search often impractical impossible There problem largest prime prove exist Therefore generally accepted must assume thing exist unless evidence Even theist follow rule time believe unicorn even though conclusively prove unicorn exist anywhere To assume God exists make assumption probably cannot tested We cannot make exhaustive search everywhere God might prove exist anywhere So sceptical atheist assumes default God exist since assumption test Those profess strong atheism usually claim sort God exists instead generally restrict claim cover variety God described follower various religion So whilst may impossible prove conclusively God exists may possible prove say God described particular religious book exist It may even possible prove God described present day religion exists In practice believing God described religion exists close believing God exists However sufficiently different counter argument based impossibility disproving every kind God really applicable But God essentially non detectable If God interacts universe way effect interaction must measurable Hence interaction universe must detectable If God essentially non detectable must therefore case interact universe way Many atheist would argue God interact universe importance whether exists If Bible believed God easily detectable Israelites Surely still detectable today Note I demanding God interact scientifically verifiable physical way It must surely possible perceive effect caused presence though otherwise I distinguish thing exist OK may think philosophical justification atheism still religious belief One common pastime philosophical discussion redefinition game The cynical view game follows Person A begin making contentious statement When person B point true person A gradually defines word used statement arrives something person B prepared accept He record statement along fact person B agreed continues Eventually A us statement agreed fact us original definition word rather obscure redefinition originally needed get B agree Rather seen apparently inconsistent B tend play along The point digression answer question Isn atheism religious belief depends crucially upon meant religious Religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power especially sort God faith worship It worth pointing passing variety Buddhism religion according definition Atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power categorized worship meaningful sense Widening definition religious encompass atheism tends result many aspect human behaviour suddenly becoming classed religious well science politics watching TV OK religion But surely belief atheism science still act faith like religion Firstly entirely clear sceptical atheism something one actually belief Secondly necessary adopt number core belief assumption make sort sense sensory data experience Most atheist try adopt core belief possible even subject questioning experience throw doubt Science number core assumption For example generally assumed law physic observer These sort core assumption atheist make If basic idea called act faith almost everything know must said based act faith term loses meaning Faith often used refer complete certain belief something According definition atheism science certainly act faith Of course individual atheist scientist dogmatic religious follower claiming something certain This general tendency however many atheist would reluctant state certainty universe exists Faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof Sceptical atheism certainly fit definition sceptical atheism belief Strong atheism closer still really match even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental data lack asserting God exist If atheism religious surely anti religious It unfortunate human tendency label everyone either friend enemy The truth clear cut Atheism position run logically counter theism sense said anti religion However religious believer speak atheist anti religious usually mean atheist sort antipathy hatred towards theist This categorization atheist hostile towards religion quite unfair Atheist attitude towards theist fact cover broad spectrum Most atheist take live let live attitude Unless questioned usually mention atheism except perhaps close friend Of course may part atheism socially acceptable many country A atheist quite anti religious may even try convert others possible Historically anti religious atheist made little impact society outside Eastern Bloc country To digress slightly Soviet Union originally dedicated separation church state like USA Soviet citizen legally free worship wished The institution state atheism came Stalin took control Soviet Union tried destroy church order gain complete power population Some atheist quite vocal belief see religion encroaching matter business example government USA Such individual usually concerned church state remain separate But allow religion say running state surely state atheism The principle separation church state state shall legislate concerning matter religious belief In particular mean state cannot promote one religion expense another also cannot promote belief religious nature Religions still say discussion purely secular matter For example religious believer historically responsible encouraging many political reform Even today many organization campaigning increase spending foreign aid founded religious campaign So long campaign concerning secular matter long discriminate religious ground atheist quite happy see say What prayer school If God care people pray Because people pray voter lawmaker tend thing pray ignore Also Christian prayer school intimidating non Christians even told need join The diversity religious non religious belief mean impossible formulate meaningful prayer acceptable present public event Also non prayer tend friend family pray It reasonable care friend family wasting time even without motif You mentioned Christians campaign increased foreign aid What atheist Why atheist charity hospital Don atheist object religious charity There many charity without religious purpose atheist contribute Some atheist contribute religious charity well sake practical good Some atheist even voluntary work charity founded theistic basis Most atheist seem feel atheism worth shouting connection charity To atheism simple obvious everyday matter charity Many feel somewhat cheap say self righteous use simple charity excuse plug particular set religious belief To weak atheist building hospital say I believe God rather strange idea rather like holding party say Today birthday Why fuss Atheism rarely evangelical You said atheism anti religious But perhaps backlash one upbringing way rebelling Perhaps But many people parent attempt force religious atheist idea upon many people choose call atheist It also doubtless case religious people chose religion backlash atheist upbringing way different On hand many people choose religion way conforming expectation others On whole conclude much whether atheism religion backlash conformism although general people tendency go along group rather act think independently How atheist differ religious people They believe God That Atheists may listen heavy metal backwards even may prefer Verdi Requiem even know word They may wear Hawaiian shirt may dress black may even wear orange robe Many Buddhists lack belief sort God Some atheist even carry copy Bible around arguing course Whoever chance met several atheist without realising Atheists usually unexceptional behaviour appearance Unexceptional But atheist le moral religious people That depends If define morality obedience God course atheist le moral obey God But usually one talk morality one talk acceptable right unacceptable wrong behaviour within society Humans social animal maximally successful must co operate This good enough reason discourage atheist anti social immoral behaviour purely purpose self preservation Many atheist behave moral compassionate way simply feel natural tendency empathize human So care happens others They know simply way Naturally people behave immorally try use atheism justify action However equally many people behave immorally try use religious belief justify action For example Here trustworthy saying deserves full acceptance Jesus Christ came world save sinner But reason I shown mercy Jesus Christ might display His unlimited patience example would believe receive eternal life Now king eternal immortal invisible God honor glory forever ever The quote statement made court February 17th 1992 Jeffrey Dahmer notorious cannibal serial killer Milwaukee Wisconsin It seems every atheist mass murderer religious mass murderer But trivial morality A survey conducted Roper Organization found behavior deteriorated born experience While 4 respondent said driven intoxicated born 12 done conversion Similarly 5 used illegal drug conversion 9 Two percent admitted engaging illicit sex salvation 5 Freethought Today September 1991 p 12 So seems best religion monopoly moral behaviour Is thing atheist morality If mean Is thing morality atheist answer yes explained Many atheist idea morality least strong held religious people If mean Does atheism characteristic moral code answer Atheism imply anything much person behave Most atheist follow many moral rule theist different reason Atheists view morality something created human according way human feel world ought work rather seeing set rule decreed supernatural Then atheist theist denying God A study Freedom From Religion Foundation found 90 atheist responded became atheist religion work They found religious belief fundamentally incompatible observed around Atheists unbeliever ignorance denial unbeliever choice The vast majority spent time studying one religion sometimes great depth They made careful considered decision reject religious belief This decision may course inevitable consequence individual personality For naturally sceptical person choice atheism often one make sense hence choice person honestly make But atheist want believe God Atheists live life though nobody watching Many desire watched matter good natured Big Brother figure might Some atheist would like able believe God Should one believe thing merely one want true The risk approach obvious Atheists often decide wanting believe something enough must evidence belief But course atheist see evidence existence God unwilling soul see Many atheist previously religious As explained vast majority seriously considered possibility God exists Many atheist spent time prayer trying reach God Of course true atheist lack open mind assuming atheist biased insincere offensive closed minded Comments Of course God looking properly likely viewed patronizing Certainly wish engage philosophical debate atheist vital give benefit doubt assume sincere say searched God If willing believe basically telling truth debate futile Isn whole life completely pointless atheist Many atheist live purposeful life They decide think give meaning life pursue goal They try make life count wishing eternal life influence people live For example atheist may dedicate life political reform hope leaving mark history It natural human tendency look meaning purpose random event However mean obvious life sort thing meaning To put another way everything look like question actually sensible thing ask Some atheist believe asking What meaning life silly asking What meaning cup coffee They believe life purpose meaning So atheist find comfort time danger There many way obtaining comfort family friend even pet Or le spiritual level food drink TV That may sound rather empty vulnerable way face danger Should individual believe thing comforting face reality matter harsh might In end decision individual concerned Most atheist unable believe something would otherwise believe merely make feel comfortable They put truth comfort consider searching truth sometimes make feel unhappy hard luck Don atheist worry might suddenly shown wrong The short answer No Many atheist atheist year They encountered many argument much supposed evidence existence God found invalid inconclusive Thousands year religious belief resulted good proof existence God Atheists therefore tend feel unlikely proved wrong immediate future stop worrying So theist question belief Don argument apply No belief questioned similar Weak atheism sceptical default position take asserts nothing Strong atheism negative belief Theism strong positive belief Atheists sometimes also argue theist question belief real harm cause believer everyone else What sort harm Religion represents huge financial work burden mankind It matter religious believer wasting money church building think time effort spent building church praying Imagine effort could better spent Many theist believe miracle healing There plenty instance ill people healed priest ceasing take medicine prescribed doctor dying result Some theist died refused blood transfusion religious ground It arguable Catholic Church opposition birth control condom particular increasing problem overpopulation many third world country contributing spread AIDS world wide Religious believer known murder child rather allow child become atheist marry someone different religion Those REAL believer They claimed believer sort excuse What make real believer There many One True Religions hard tell Look Christianity many competing group convinced true Christians Sometimes even fight kill How atheist supposed decide REAL Christian even major Christian church like Catholic Church Church England decide amongst In end atheist take pragmatic view decide anyone call Christian us Christian belief dogma justify action considered Christian Maybe Christians perverting Christian teaching end surely Bible readily used support un Christian act much moral code If Bible word God made le easy misinterpret And know belief perversion God intended If single unambiguous interpretation Bible atheist take one interpretation another say Sorry someone claim belief Jesus murdered others Jesus Bible told must call Christian Obviously extreme sort belief questioned But since nobody ever proved God exist must unlikely basic religious belief shared faith nonsense That hold pointed start dialogue positive assertion concerning existence entity inherently much harder disprove negative one Nobody ever proved unicorn exist make unlikely myth It therefore much valid hold negative assertion default hold positive assertion default Of course weak atheist would argue asserting nothing better still Well atheism great many theist Unfortunately popularity belief little correct whether work consider many people believe astrology graphology pseudo science Many atheist feel simply human weakness want believe god Certainly many primitive human society religion allows people deal phenomenon adequately understand Of course religion In industrialized world find people believing religious explanation phenomenon even perfectly adequate natural explanation Religion may started mean attempting explain world nowadays serf purpose well But many culture developed religion Surely must say something Not really Most religion superficially similar example worth remembering religion Buddhism Taoism lack sort concept God Christian sense Of course religion quick denounce competing religion rather odd use one religion try justify another What famous scientist philosopher concluded God exists For every scientist philosopher belief god one Besides already pointed truth belief determined many people believe Also important realize atheist view famous scientist philosopher way theist view religious leader A famous scientist human may expert field talk matter word carry special weight Many respected scientist made look foolish speaking subject lie outside field expertise So really saying widespread belief religion indicates nothing Not entirely It certainly indicates religion question property helped spread far The theory memetics talk meme set idea propagate human mind analogy gene Some atheist view religion set particularly successful parasitic meme spread encouraging host convert others Some meme avoid destruction discouraging believer questioning doctrine using peer pressure keep one time believer admitting mistaken Some religious meme even encourage host destroy host controlled meme Of course memetic view particular virtue associated successful propagation meme Religion good thing number people believe disease good thing number people caught Even religion entirely true least put across important message What fundamental message atheism There many important idea atheist promote The following surprised see idea also present religion There moral behaviour mindlessly following rule Be especially sceptical positive claim If want life sort meaning find Search true even make uncomfortable Make life probably one It good relying external power change must change Just something popular

martin c unc edu jon robot ox ac uk Note server NOT part XFree86 7 Why XFree86 support 16 color VGA mode The reason supported way VGA implement 16 color mode In 256 color mode byte frame buffer memory contains 1 pixel But 16 color mode implemented bit plane Each byte frame buffer memory contains 1 bit 8 pixel four plane The MIT frame buffer code designed deal If VGA handled 16 color mode packing 2 4 bit pixel byte MIT code could modified support already may I sure But VGA way thing complete new frame buffer implementation required Some beta tester looking nothing yet available project 8 What hardware software requirement Obviously supported SVGA board OS required To run X efficiently 12 16MB memory considered minimum The various binary release take 10 40MB disk space depending OS e g whether support shared library To build source least 80MB free disk space required although 120MB considered comfortable lower bound 9 Where I get source XFree86 Source patch current version 1 2 based

function may called safely may assumed function called Xlib Xt function The safe way deal signal set flag interrupt handler This flag later need checked either work procedure timeout callback It incorrect add either interrupt handler As another note dangerous add work procedure never finish This effectively preempt work procedure previously added never called Another option open pipe tell event loop read end using XtAppAddInput signal handler write byte write end pipe signal However could deadlock process pipe fill Why Intrinsics deal problem Primarily supposed portable layer hardware operating system Is good enough reason I think Note article The X Journal 1 4 example O Reilly Volume 6 error 4 How I use different visual default This requires complicated answer A window three thing visual specific visual colormap border pixmap All widget Colormap BorderPixmap resource shell widget Visual resource another question deal shell Visual The default value resource CopyFromParent

value depends visual used How get work There two part answer The first want application start particular visual second want particular shell within application start different visual The second actually easier basic information need available The first little harder need initialize much toolkit order determine needed information Some sample code start application using something default

6 Why Shell widget Visual This strictly convention It make possible arbitrary widget know visual us found looking shell widget ancestor obtaining visual shell A widget visual resource If must realize

copy colormap depth parent us CopyFromParent visual 8 I done I still get BadMatch error Why Some resource converter improperly cache reference This especially true X11R3 earlier version Motif 9 Why widget get destroyed I call XtDestroyWidget See section 2 8 Xt specification It eventually get destroyed immediately The Intrinsics destroy widget two phase process First child flag set indicate destroyed It put list widget destroyed This way pending X event reference widget cleaned memory actually freed The second phase performed callback event handler action completed checking next X event At point list traversed widget memory actually free among thing As caveat trivia widget may destroyed Intrinsics determine reference widget list If phase 2 destruction occurs immediately Also nested event loop used widget placed destroy list entering inner event loop destroyed returning outer event loop 10 How I exit still execute DestroyCallbacks The problem simple entirely reasonable approach exiting application used calling exit directly widget may chance clean external state open socket temporary file allocated X resource etc code simplicity reason assumes single toplevel widget Widget ToplevelGet gw Widget gw widget find toplevel Widget top top gw XtParent top top XtParent top empty return top void ExitCallback gw closure call_data Widget gw widget XtPointer closure data app specified XtPointer call_data widget specific data Widget toplevel toplevel ToplevelGet gw XtUnmapWidget toplevel make disappear quickly XtDestroyWidget toplevel exit 0 One see code exit immediately destroying toplevel widget The trouble phase 2 destruction may never occur This work widget application work widget external state You might think since work always work remember part reason object oriented approach used one ignorant implementation detail widget Which mean widget may change someday require external state cleaned Destroy callback One alternative modify ExitCallback set global flag test flag private event loop However private event loop frowned upon tends encourage sloppy difficult maintain practice Try following code instead include X11 Intrinsic h extern Widget

XtAppAddWorkProc XtWidgetToApplicationContext gw ExitWorkProc XtPointer NULL Boolean ExitWorkProc closure XtPointer closure exit 0 ExitCallback add work procedure get called application next idle happens event processed destroy callback executed 11 How I resize Shell widget After realized one resize Shell widget The proper thing resize currently managed child Shell widget using XtSetValues The geometry change propagated Shell asks window manager may may allow request However Shell must resource XtNallowShellResize set True otherwise even ask window manager grant request Shell resize To change position Shell use XtSetValues Shell child within limit window manager granted 12 Why XtAppAddInput handle file It however Unix semantics I O ready file fit people intuitive model In Unix term file descriptor ready reading whenever read call would block ignoring setting optional flag indicate block This work expected terminal socket pipe For file read always return return indicates EOF e data The result code Intrinsics always call input handler always think something read The culprit select system call SYSV based OS poll system call How get around Unix system The best approach use another process check available input file Use pipe connect application process pas file descriptor pipe XtAppAddInput A suitable program BSD system tail f filename It rumored select system _completely_ reliable In particular IBM AIX 3 1 one would work several thousand time stop event woke This seemed result race condition Kernel IBM claim fix Pyramid work Ultrix possibly others pipe implemented socket completely broken although writing side wrote 512 byte block reading side received broken put pipe byte time You waste lot time reading small block get raound detecting situation select ignore pipe 10 mseconds given whole block Note description used Unix terminology read file descriptor pipe etc This OS dependent area may identical system However Intrinsic designer felt common enough operation included part toolkit Why also deal signal point I know 13 What good book magazine Xt I favorite definitive reference To perspective offer reasonable introduction also go full detail

following discussion resource converter assumes R4 R5 Intrinsics Resource converter changed R3 R4 allow destructors caching converted value There several main type resource converter string data type data type string data type data type string data type Usually string data type converter fixed set string converted data type value This often used map enumerated name enumerated value Name Value True 1 False 0 In case string data type converter need compare resource value list fixed string This readily accomplished use quark mechanism resource manager The resource value turned quark unique representation string fit single word Then resource quark compared quark fixed string representing enumerated value If many enumerated string converter many converter small number enumeration string global initialization routine might used turn resource string quark That way first time one converter used string turned quark held static variable use next invocation one converter ii data type string This type converter slightly easier string data type converter since use quark necessary Instead data type value simply converted string value probably use sprintf Data type string converter useful application wish convert internal data type value string write valid resource specification file This mechanism used provide snapshot application state file This snapshot used restore program known state via usual X resource database mechanism If taking trouble write string data type converter much extra effort write data type string converter Writing time help ensure consistent iii data type data type This type converter used convert existing data type value another data type For instance X pixel value converted RGB data type contains separate field red green blue The type signature resource converter follows typedef Boolean XtTypeConverter Display XrmValuePtr Cardinal XrmValuePtr XrmValuePtr XtPointer Display dpy XrmValuePtr args Cardinal num_args XrmValuePtr fromVal XrmValuePtr toVal XtPointer converter_data When converter invoked fromVal argument point source X resource manager value toVal argument point destination X resource manager value The converter_data argument opaque pointer converter specific data specified converter registered The args num_args argument allow extra information passed converter invoked For instance Pixel RGB structure converter discussed would need colormap visual argument lookup Pixel obtain RGB value corresponding pixel Care must taken toVal argument An XrmValue following type definition specifies size location converted value typedef struct unsigned int size caddr_t addr XrmValue XrmValuePtr When converter invoked address may point location given size converted value location NULL In former case converter ensure size destination area large enough handle converted value If destination area large enough converter set size amount space needed return False The caller ensure enough space allocated reinvoke converter If size large enough converter simply copy converted value space given return True If location NULL converter assign location address static variable containing converted value return True When writing group converter code often repeated becomes convenient define macro define DONE var type toVal addr toVal size sizeof type toVal size sizeof type return False else type toVal addr var else toVal addr caddr_t var toVal size sizeof type return True define DONESTR str toVal addr toVal size sizeof String toVal size sizeof String return False else toVal addr caddr_t str toVal size sizeof String return True Inside converter good idea perform little safety checking num_args args argument ensure converter called properly Once written converter need register Intrinsics The Intrinsics invokes resource converter creating widget fetching resource value resource database To register converter single application context use XtAppSetTypeConverter void XtAppSetTypeConverter context converter args num_args cache destructor XtAppContext context String String XtTypeConverter converter XtConvertArgList args Cardinal num_args XtCacheType cache XtDestructor destructor To register converter application context use XtSetTypeConverter void XtSetTypeConverter converter args num_args cache destructor String String XtTypeConverter converter XtConvertArgList args Cardinal num_args XtCacheType cache XtDestructor destructor In R3 Intrinsics routine XtAppAddConverter XtAddConverter superseded XtAppSetTypeConverter XtSetTypeConverter Whenever possible newer routine used When converter registered Intrinsics cache argument specifies converted resource value cached XtCacheNone Don cache converted value XtCacheAll Cache converted value XtCacheByDisplay Cache converted value per display basis Caching converted value require round trip server good idea instance string Pixel conversion The destructor argument routine invoked resource destroyed either cached reference count decremented zero widget owning value destroyed XtDestructor following type definition typedef void XtDestructor XtAppContext XrmValuePtr XtPointer XrmValuePtr Cardinal XtAppContext context XrmValuePtr XtPointer converter_data XrmValuePtr args Cardinal num_args The destructor invoked free auxiliary storage associated argument actually free storage pointed argument addr The destructor passed extra argument passed converter conversion performed instance colormap visual argument string Pixel converter since destructor would need free allocated Pixel colormap well private data passed converter registered

display removing display If read Oliver Jones article The third one difficult handle The following based Oliver Jones article I include difficult problem The difficulty arises Xlib design presumed I O error always unrecoverable fatal This essentially true single display X based application true multiple display program application thing display information X server When X I O error occurs I O error handler called _if_ return exit happens The way around use setjmp longjmp avoid returning I O error handler The following code fragment demonstrates include setjmp h jmp_buf XIOrecover void XIOHandler dpy Display dpy destroyDisplay dpy longjmp XIOrecover 1 main setjmp XIOrecover 0 XSetIOErrorHandler XIOHandler XtAppMainLoop app_context The destroyDisplay something given Display pointer go back application specific data perform necessary cleanup It also call XtCloseDisplay For unfamiliar setjmp longjmp setjmp first called return 0 save enough information jmp_buf latter execution longjmp return program state setjmp executed The return value second setjmp value second argument longjmp There several caveat using purpose adequate Some problem might run resource converter improperly cache

XFILESEARCHPATH XUSERFILESEARCHPATH XAPPLRESDIR These environment variable control Xt look application default file application initializing Xt load one app default file path defined XFILESEARCHPATH another path defined XUSERFILESEARCHPATH Set XFILESEARCHPATH software installed system way app default file appear several different directory hierarchy Suppose example running Sun Open Windows also R4 X application installed usr lib X11 app default You could set value like XFILESEARCHPATH would cause Xt look app default file usr lib X11 usr openwin lib wherever OPENWINHOME located setenv XFILESEARCHPATH usr lib X11 T N OPENWINHOME lib T N The value environment variable colon separated list pathnames The pathnames contain replacement character follows see XtResolvePathname N The value filename parameter application class name T The value file type In case literal string app default C customization resource R5 S Suffix None app default L Language locale codeset e g ja_JP EUC l Language part L e g ja The territory part display language string c The codeset part display language string Let take apart example Suppose application class name Myterm Also suppose Open Windows installed usr openwin Notice example omits locale specific lookup usr lib X11 T N mean usr lib X11 app default Myterm OPENWINHOME lib T N mean usr openwin lib app default Myterm As application initializes Xt try open app default file order shown As soon find one read us stop looking others The effect path search first usr lib X11 usr openwin Let consider another example This time let set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH look file Myterm ad current working directory Myterm directory app default setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH N ad HOME app default N The first path list expands Myterm ad The second expands HOME app default Myterm This convenient setting debugging follows Imake convention naming app default file Myterm ad application source directory run application directory working still resource loaded properly NOTE looking app default file XUSERFILESEARCHPATH bizarre reason neither type file suffix defined T S useless With R5 another twist You may specify customization resource value For example might run myterm application like myterm xrm customization color If one pathname specification value usr lib X11 app default N C expanded pathname would usr lib X11 app default Myterm color C substitution character take value customization resource The default XFILESEARCHPATH compiled Xt usr lib X11 L T N C R5 usr lib X11 l T N C R5 usr lib X11 T N C R5 usr lib X11 L T N usr lib X11 l T N usr lib X11 T N Note site replace usr lib X11 ProjectRoot batch default setting The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH also compiled Xt root L N C R5 root l N C R5 root N C R5 root L N root l N root N root either value XAPPLRESDIR user home directory XAPPLRESDIR set If set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH value default Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether Notice quick dirty way making application find app default file current working directory set XAPPLRESDIR single dot In R3 machinery worked differently R3 compatibilty many people set XAPPLRESDIR value dot followed slash 21 What order callback

map_state field returned call XGetWindowAttributes These suggestion 23 How I reparent widget Xt e XtReparentWidget You 24 Why use XtMalloc XtFree etc Unfortunately code call malloc realloc calloc tends ignore possibility returning NULL At best handled something like ptr type malloc sizeof type ptr perror malloc xyzzy exit 1 To handle common case Intrinsics define function XtMalloc XtCalloc XtNew XtNewString XtRealloc use standard C language function malloc calloc realloc execute XtErrorMsg NULL value returned Xt error handler supposed return effectively exit In addition XtRealloc called NULL pointer us XtMalloc get initial space This allows code like ptr ptr type malloc sizeof type else ptr type realloc ptr sizeof type count 1 count written ptr XtRealloc ptr sizeof ptr count Also XtFree accepts NULL pointer argument Generally I found Xt function conveniant use However anytime I allocating anything potentially large I use standard function I fully recover enough memory error XtNew XtNewString conveniant macro allocating structure copying string struct abc xyzzy char ptr char str abcdef xyzzy XtNew struct abc take care type casting ptr XtNewString str A strict interpretation Intrinsics reference manual allow implementation provide function exchangable malloc free I e code char ptr ptr XtMalloc 100 free ptr may work Personally I call implementation broken complain vendor A common error Motif programmer use XtFree string really using XmStringFree 25 How debug Xt application First I recomend getting purify Pure Software This great package tracing memory

baseball game past several year He devised algorithm I call sum situation wrote computer program calculate every major league player contribution using It work like Look every situation every game baseball season A situation determined inning score baserunners many out For situation count many time team eventually game situation occured divide number time situation came come value situation This first done George Lindsey late 50 early 60 reported Article An Investigation Strategies Baseball Author George R Lindsey Journal Operations Research Issue Volume 11 4 July August 1963 pp 477 501 Later Pete Palmer thing using simulated season generate larger set data avoid kind small sample anomaly people worried He reported _The_Hidden_Game_of_Baseball_ John Thorn Gary Skoog modified method bit work called Value Added measure based situational value His based directly marginal run though win probability These result applied 198 season reported one Bill James Baseball Abstract book 1987 Help somebody For example situation might inning 3 score 2 0 runner second out There 4212 regular season major league game last year With Rockies Marlins year Say situation came 100 team ahead 75 Then value situation 0 75 Description method look change win probability based bat plus baserunning credit debit player amount time get plate appearance Now player sum bat base running value season obtain overall value player Obviously sum player value game season whole 0 That always credit x batter x pitcher validation involved OK big problem nobody yet commented adding probability probability add Runs add total team run break many run Joe contributed plus many run Fred contributed etc But probability work way If Bob increase team chance winning 1 400 PAs mean Bob increased team chance winning 400 In fact mean anything unit screwy I agree disagree John saying batter effort result 4 win loss While probably correct 400 mean 4 win loss mean something I would rather player increased team chance winning 1 400 PAs I would player increased chance winning 5 400 PAs Thus appears obvious positive association John statistic winning game Thus disregard stat appears study must go sort relationship Consider example Bob hit 2 solo HR bottom first 12 scale He thing fourth score tied another 14 And seventh score tied another 22 And finally ninth win game score 7 6 value 0 5 Bob hit 4 solo HR 4 plate appearance credited method 12 14 22 5 98 But mean Was Bob 98 responsible win Certainly defense always 50 responsible include pitching Bob pitching In fact Bob 4 7 offense lot even close 100 Furthermore 3 team run Say came solo HR Fred Fred hitting HR tie game valuable HR take lead see Lindsey Fred accrued good 4 rating So Fred Bob combined amassed 138 win IN ONE GAME There clearly problem The problem insistance number mean exactly many win team First using average many season applying one game Second remember player performance take away chance winning That player get get negative probability case Thus I sure given game add number team add 1 game Sometimes add one sometime le one Also pitcher bad performance giving 6 run may given large negative percentage game Also batter pulled 0 4 night would give large negative Greg thinking right thing intuition mark Closers enormously important The total number run value outweighed come prevented comming The doubling Greg allows enough In another article I proposed test We predict team lost record quite accurately looking many run total score allow without regard run score game If late run really important early run looking late run lead better predictor right No really smaller sample size I would think however number run score first inning would good prediction many run score last inning And realize something else closer usually come close situation blow It hard argue run closer give game equal importance given first inning Look closer giving run often mean team lose many game On hand starter give run often still leaf team chance win The offence many out something But I saying late inning situation equally important either If I 8 run ninth really matter many run pitcher give ninth Here another

mention exactly case I going make But I think reason Lemieux 168 point season first non Gretzky win Hart Ross since 1980 People turned watch play I grant star like Mario draw fan even team suck But short term I still think attendance increase last unless team winning competitive improving butt kicking one Pittsburgh still getting better people continued support If suddenly dropped say 50 point

effect Kings initial success following Gretzky arrival 68 91 point source corresponding attendance jump effective drop attendance even though ticket sale may changed much Whether Kings winner debatable I claim since Gretzky arrival least competitive I also claim McNall made stupid move trying reassemble Oiler dynasty another story included I like McNall Anyway McNall heavy marketing around Gretzky undoubtedly also responsible attendance merchandising sale etc But I said Kings little tailspin past couple year empty seat Forum even ticket sold I think case Lemieux Gretzky player transcend winning major drawing power For short term IMO Although I think inevitable team improve player Lemieux Gretzky simply make people around better But winning sure hell help Well least full agreement

hockey sure hell winning Yes worse last year I think type reasoning I applied new Pittsburgh fan applies extra people showing Winnipeg game It difficult predict think Jets miss playoff next season

private key RSA generally believed resistant standard cryptanalytic technique Even standard key 516 bit RIPEM long enough render impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring Breaking DES would allow attacker read given message since message encrypted DES It would allow attacker claim DES 56 bit key thus could conceivably compromised brute force sufficient hardware agency money devote simply read one message Since message different DES key work message would remain high Stealing private key would allow benefit breaking RSA To safeguard encrypted DES key derived passphrase type However attacker get copy private keyfile passphrase snooping network packet tapping line whatever could break whole scheme The main risk transferring either passphrase private key file across untrusted link So Run RIPEM trusted machine preferably one sitting right front Ideally machine home maybe office nobody else physical access Fooling accepting bogus public key someone else could allow opponent deceive sending secret message rather real recipient If enemy fool intended recipient well could encrypt message bogus public key pas along It important get proper public key people The common mechanism finger assuming opponent compromised router daemon finger given fair amount trust The strongest method key authentication exchange key person however always practical Having people vouch signing statement containing key possible although RIPEM feature automatically PGP RIPEM generate check MD5 fingerprint public key key file may exchanged via separate channel authentication Even opponent cannot break cryptography opponent could still cause difficulty For example suppose send message MIC ONLY PEM mode provide disclosure protection Alice say OK let Your opponent intercept resends Bob message authenticated telling Of course may interpret entirely different context Or opponent could transmit message recipient much later figuring would seen differently later time Or opponent could change Originator Name register public key send message hoping recipient send return mail indicating perhaps even quoting unknown message To defeat playback attack plaintext message include indication sender recipient unique identifier typically date A good front end script RIPEM automatically IMHO As recipient sure Originator Name header sender indicated within plaintext really recipient message old one Some also automated The author FAQ made modest attempt automating process generating checking encapsulated header program included standard distribution utils directory Clearly security RIPEM cannot greater security machine encryption performed For example UNIX super user could manage get encrypted mail although would take planning effort something like replace RIPEM executable Trojan horse get copy plaintext depending stored In addition link machine running RIPEM extension If decrypt RIPEM remote machine connected via network worse yet modem eavesdropper could see plaintext probably also passphrase RIPEM executed system trust obviously In extreme case RIPEM used machine total control nobody else access carefully examined software known free virus However real trade convenience security A moderately cautious user might use RIPEM UNIX workstation people access even root access increase security keeping private key statically linked course executable floppy disk Some people keep RIPEM multi user system dialing insecure line download message system perform RIPEM decryption However security provided mechanism somewhat illusory

rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authentication I find nice put brief statement carefully I manage security arrangement plan next public key potential correspondent aware level precaution

following answer translation provided Ken Jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov The Ascent Guidance Flight Control Training Manual ASC G C 2102 say During vertical rise phase launch pad attitude commanded I loaded V rel sufficient assure launch tower clearance achieved Then tilt maneuver roll program orient vehicle head attitude required generate negative q alpha turn alleviates structural loading Other advantage attitude performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved S band look angle crew view horizon The tilt maneuver also required start gaining downrange velocity achieve main engine cutoff MECO target second stage This really good answer couched NASA jargon I try interpret 1 We wait Shuttle clear tower rolling 2 Then roll Shuttle around angle attack wind caused passage atmosphere relative wind chord wing imaginary line leading edge trailing edge slightly negative angle negative q alpha This cause little bit downward force toward belly Orbiter Z direction force alleviates structural loading We careful wing delicate part vehicle 3 The new attitude roll also allows u carry mass orbit achieve higher orbit mass change orbit higher lower inclination would case roll performance gain 4 The new attitude allows crew fly le complicated flight path execute one dangerous abort maneuver Return To Launch Site decreased abort maneuver complexity 5 The new attitude improves ability ground based radio antenna good line sight signal S band radio antenna Orbiter improved S band look angle 6 The new attitude allows crew see horizon helpful mandatory part piloting flying machine 7 The new attitude orient Shuttle body nearly parallel ground nose east usually This allows thrust engine add velocity correct direction eventually achieve orbit Remember velocity vector quantity made speed direction The Shuttle large horizontal component velocity small vertical component attain orbit This begs question Why launch pad oriented

however insult intelligence serious scholar field data many flaw I feel compelled write length call attention various major minor failing particular order 1 The author misleadingly cite Wright et al Ref 1 support statement argued restricting access handgun could substantially reduce annual rate homicide Wright et al fact studied rejected contention 2 The author pretended Vancouver Seattle similar city similar economic circumstance history demographic characteristic like In fact city different different demographic characteristic appear explain completely higher homicide rate Seattle Both city three forth non Hispanic white non Hispanic white homicide rate reported Seattle Vancouver It different back ground problem circumstance behavior various ethnic minority explain difference homicide 3 The author pretend evaluating Canada gun law compared Washington State But examine situation Vancouver prior gun law taking effect 1978 As happens three year prior 1975 1977 Vancouver averaged 23 homicide per year one eighth involving handgun Ref 2 seven year NEJM article 29 homicide per year one eigth involving handgun Surely even medical profession recognizes one must look see prior

exceeds wild west city Texas El Paso Corpus Christi Austen Colorado Colorado Springs Ref 3 5 The author fail clearly demonstrate firearm handgun far commonly owned Seattle Vancouver They use two surrogate approach pretending study availability firearm handgun The first apple orange effort compare number carry permit Seattle number registered handgun Vancouver But number clearly understates

protection registration figure meaningless There 66 000 registered handgun New York City New York Daily News Sept 27 1987 Comparing two method suggests 930 handgun per 100 000 population New York City

James D Wright July 1989 issue REASON Free Minds Free Markets Someone wrote Statistics like bikini What real suggestive conceal vital The problem demonstrated recent entry long line scientific research purporting show causal link gun availability homicide Funded federal government published last year New England Journal Medicine study compared homicide rate Seattle Vancouver suggested handgun ban may reduce rate homicide community The nine medical doctor published Handgun Regulations Crime Assaults Homicide essentially reasoned three step 1 Despite many historical social demographic similarity 2 Vancouver markedly lower homicide rate 3 stricter gun regulation make gun le available The second step reasoning seems indisputable The overall homicide rate Seattle period 1980 86 11 3 per 100 000 popuation compared 6 9 Vancouver Homicide definitely common Seattle The question becomes The author present believable although entirely accurate case support notion claimed third step reasoning Vancouver handgun regulation much stringent But evidence difference gun availabilty indirect unpersuasive indeed acknowledge direct evidence point exist They offer two fragment inferential data support claim gun available Seattle anybody know matter empirical fact opposite could true We therefore asked conclusion study believe difference gun availability explains difference homicide rate difference gun availability established Indeed situation even troublesome The first two indirect bit evidence difference number concealed weapon permit issued Seattle number restricted weapon permit issued Vancouver Differences two city permit regulation render two number strictly noncomparable The second bit evidence Cook gun prevalence index stand 41 percent Seattle 12 percent Vancouver Cook index however measure relative prevalence gun ownership various city It measure gun misuse average percentage homicide suicide involving firearm In present case index show homicide suicide firearm likely used Seatte Vancouver To take Cook index measure general firearm availability must assumed proportional involvement gun homicide suicide directly related relative availability general population But exactly author seeking prove To assume one seeking prove prove basis assumption ot constitute scientific evidence anything Even grant basis compelling evidence gun le common Vancouver might still question cause The author attribute Seattle higher crime rate higher rate gun ownership But might well argued low crime homicide rate reduce motivation average citizen obtain gun word crime rate explain variation gun ownership vice versa In fact commonly argued Great Britain low rate violent crime function nation strict gun law consequent low rate gun ownership British researcher Colin Greenwood found Great Britain enjoyed low rate violent crime many decade strict firearm control enacted To invoke ancient methodological saw correlation cause Nor problem study end lack direct data gun ownership The author say Seattle Vancouver similar many way implying differ mainly gun availability gun law stringency crime rate This evident attempt establish ceteris paribus condition sound scientific analysis else equal among thing compared Clearly two city similar way closer look reveals difference way relevant respective crime homicide rate The city closely matched percentage population white 79 percent 76 percent But Seattle 10 percent black Vancouver le 0 5 percent Vancouver minority population overwhelmingly Asian So although author show th two city approximately comparable half dozen readily available demographic indicator shown potentially relevant source variation ruled In fact difference racial composition two city particularly relevant light study breakdown homicide rate according race victim For white majority homicide rate nearly identical 6 2 per 100 000 Seattle 6 4 Vancouver The differing overall homicide rate two city therefore due entirely vastly different rate among racial minority For black observed difference homicide rate 36 6 9 5 Hispanics 26 9 7 9 Methodoligical complexity render Asian comparison problematic higher Seattle Vancouver Racial minority much likely victim homicide Seattle Vancouver white majority equally likely slain either city Since nearly 2 1 initial difference homicide reates city due exclusively 3 1 4 1 difference minority group fair ask postulated difference gun availability gun law strigency would matter dramatically minority matter white Can differential gun availability explain black Hispanics white much likely killed Seattle Vancouver Studies United States incidentally show large consistent racial difference gun ownership Or explanation plausible Could disparity Canadian American rate poverty among racial minority anything What relative rate drug alcohol abuse Of homelessness among cty minority population The city Seattle run largest shelter homeless men west Mississippi Unemployment among young central city nonwhite men United States usually exceeds 40 percent What comparable Canadian percentage The crucial point Canada United States differ many way city population subgroup two country Absent detailed analysis nearly many way might explain part difference homicide rate In gross comparison Seattle Vancouver else equal The author study acknowledge racial pattern homicide result complex picture They acknowledge ensuing complexity seriously undercut main thrust argument They also acknowledge socio economic status probably important confounding factor comparison remarking black Vancouver slightly higher mean income 1981 rest Vancouver population Given evidence presented article possible difference homicide rate Seattle Vancouver result greater proverty among Seattle racial minority But author pay attention possibility since detailed information household income according race available Vancouver The largely insurmountable methodological difficulty confronted gross comparative study sort illustrated simple example If one take U S couties compare term 1 pervalence gun ownership 2 crime homicide rate one would find astonishing pattern Counties gun le crime Would one conclude evidence alone gun actually reduce crime Or would one insist variable also taken account In example hidden variable city size Guns common small town rural area whereas crime big city problem If researcher failed anticipate variable lacked appropriate data examine possible consequence coud seriously misled In study hand author matched two city size minority poverty rate hidden variable result impossible interpret In editorial Firearm Injuries A Call Science accompanying study two official Centers Disease Control lauded author applying scientific method problem
