C SLIPPER ver 1 3 work application I tested One two application required ethernet simulation balked C SLIPPER 1 2 even rare problem resolved ver 1 3 When SLIPPER used ethernet simulation mode used PKTMUX I get error message QVTNet Console window read IP incorrect packet type IP bad version number This seem prevent QVTnet functioning although I cannot comment loss performance What DOS TCP IP
